# blackhole1
made a project on simulating non rotating black hole under Newtonian gravity

##Realistic Physics: 
Uses actual gravitational constant and speed of light 
Implements Schwarzschild radius calculation 
Adds simple relativistic effects (Lorentz factor) 
Simulates temperature gradient in accretion disk 
Enhanced Visuals: 
Custom colormaps for accretion disk and relativistic jets 
Photon sphere and gravitational lensing effects 
Background stars with lensing distortion 
Particle size and color vary with temperature/velocity 
##Features: 
Simulated relativistic jets from the poles 
Dynamic particle regeneration system 
Proper scaling using physical units 
Animated background for depth effect 
##Aesthetic Improvements: 
Better color schemes (from deep purples to hot whites) 
Multiple visual components (event horizon, photon sphere, etc.) 
Informative title with physics details 
Smooth particle fading and regeneration 
## simulation shows: 
A hot, turbulent accretion disk 
Particles spiraling inward and disappearing at the event horizon 
Relativistic jets perpendicular to the disk plane 
Gravitational lensing effects on background stars 
Temperature-based coloring of the accretion disk
